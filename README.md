- **09 Exception-Handling/** - Error handling and exception management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### How to Use
1. Navigate to the topic you want to study
2. Open the corresponding `.cpp` file
3. Read the comments and code examples
4. Compile and run the code to see it in action

### Example Usage
```bash
# Compile a C++ file
g++ filename.cpp -o filename

# Run the compiled program
./filename
```

## üìù Code Examples

Each file contains:
- Detailed comments explaining the concept
- Multiple approaches to solve problems
- Test cases and edge cases
- Performance analysis where applicable
- Learning points and best practices

### Sample: Palindrome Number Problem
The repository includes comprehensive solutions to LeetCode problems, such as the Palindrome Number problem with four different approaches:
- String conversion method
- Mathematical approach
- Half reversal (optimal)
- Long long overflow handling
